# Graphical User Interface

Our first approach towards a solution was to implement a file reading interface.
We did this by using Java's own library of interfaces, with a file chooser that allows the user to browse the files in their PC and select the one they desire.
What the code currently does is receive a txt file from the file chooser and print its content on the text area.
